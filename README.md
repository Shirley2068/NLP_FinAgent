# ðŸ“ˆ __FinAgent: Multi-Agent AI for Bitcoin Analytics & Forecasting__ ðŸ“Š

## __Introduction__

This repository showcases an AI multi-agent system designed for comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis, with a particular focus on Bitcoin (BTC), tailored for my MBA Dissertation Thesis. The system leverages artificial intelligence agents and machine learning models to extract, process, and analyze historical cryptocurrency data.

Our multi-agent framework consists of several specialized agents working in concert:

â€¢ **Financial Analyst Agent**: Collect and summarize recent news articles, press releases, and market analyses related to the cryptocurrency BTC and its industry.

â€¢ **Research Analyst Agent**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the cryptocurrency's financial health and market performance.

â€¢ **Investment Advisor Agent**: Review and synthesize the analyses provided by the Financial Analyst and the Research Analyst, combining these insights to form a comprehensive investment recommendation, by leveraging an AI model for price prediction.

At the core of our system is a sophisticated ML model, employed by the Investment Advisor Agent, which serves as a powerful tool for price prediction. This model is trained on historical data.

## ðŸ’¡ __Analysis Insights__

â€¢ Focused on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to track price changes and volatility since 2018.

â€¢ Developed candlestick charts for detailed price movement analysis.

â€¢ Constructed a correlation matrix to understand inter-relationships between different cryptocurrencies.

â€¢ Build up Tree-based model for Feature Selection.

â€¢ Build Time-Series model for BTC Price Prediction.

â€¢ Build AI multi-agent system for comprehensive BTC reporting.


## ðŸŽ¯ __Project Objectives__

â€¢ __*Data Acquisition*__

Automate the retrieval of historical price data for various cryptocurrencies using the yfinance library.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Example to fetch historical data for Bitcoin
btc_data = yf.download("BTC-USD", start="2018-01-01", end="2023-12-31")
```

â€¢ __*Data Preprocessing*__

Clean and preprocess the acquired data to ensure accuracy and reliability for further analysis.

â€¢ __*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*__

Conduct an in-depth EDA to examine trends, correlations, and distribution characteristics of cryptocurrency data.

â€¢ __*Investment Report Generation*__

The multi-agent approach allows for a more robust, efficient, and comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrency data, enabling us to uncover complex patterns and trends that might be missed by traditional single-model approaches.
